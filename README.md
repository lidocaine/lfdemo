# Transcending History and the World
### A Tale of Souls and Swords, Eternally Retold
I decided to setup a quick WP install and make sure everything was functional and looking decent. I used [Understrap](https://understrap.com/) as a starter theme so I wouldn't have to worry about a lot of those WP defaults (or the fact that all of the core themes are horrendous). The full working demo is on the Team Demo(https://lfdemo.austhvn.com/team/) page and a summary of the files I created/edited to get everything working can be found further below.

Thank you all again for this opportunity! For ease of review, I pushed a public repository to Github of the theme itself located here:Â [https://github.com/lidocaine/lfdemo](https://github.com/lidocaine/lfdemo)
